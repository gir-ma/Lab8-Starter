### Graceful degradation vs Service workers 
From the above expeirnce I noticed that graceful degradation is about ensuring web apps provide basic functionality even when advanced features are not available. Service workers enable graceful degradation by caching resources, so apps can still work offline or with poor connectivity by serving cached content instead of breaking entirely. The exercise showed how service workers cache initial content and intercept requests to progressively enhance the experience when online. This implements graceful degradation by allowing apps to degrade gracefully to an offline-first, cached experience if needed.
